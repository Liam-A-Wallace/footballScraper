Stage 1 (Scraping):
Mostly complete

will want to get around to scraping the other tables in player stats
NEW PROBLEM players that have played for 2 teams will be stored under the 2nd team in ranks
Stage 2 (Storing):
league table storing is adequte for both csv and database

player stats able to be stored in csv with some flaws
database not able to store yet
missing some key stats for goalkeepers and other misc stats that could provide better analysis

curious if linking the tables would provide any benefit i guess so
splitting outfielders with goalkeepers? (apparently not)
Stage 3 (Visualising):
Not Started

Stage 4 (Flask and web product):
Not Started
